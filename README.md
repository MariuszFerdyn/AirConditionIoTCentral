# AirConditionIoTCentral
This project allows you to control Air Conditioning using Azure IoT Central.
Commands to Air Conditioning will be sent via Infrared (first we record them from the original Remote Controller).

# Prerequisites
Install and customize (connect to network) your Raspberry Pi. Any Zero, Zero W, 1A+, 1B+, 2B, 3B, 3B+, 3A+, 4B, 400, CM1, CM3, CM3+, CM4, CM4S, Zero 2 W are supported. The best way is to use Raspberry Pi Imager https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/.
